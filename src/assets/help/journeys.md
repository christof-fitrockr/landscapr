# Journeys

Journeys represent the end-to-end paths that customers or users take when interacting with your organization. They help you visualize the sequence of steps, touchpoints, and the underlying processes that support them.

## Journey List
The **Journey List** view shows all existing journeys.
- Use the **Search** bar to filter journeys by name.
- Click **Create** to start a new journey.
- Click **View/Edit** (pencil icon) on a journey to open the **Journey Editor**.

## Journey Editor
The Journey Editor is a powerful visual tool for mapping out journeys.

### Toolbar

- **Navigation:** Buttons to return to the List or Base settings.
- **Tools:**
    - **Select (Pointer):** Click to select nodes or edges. Drag to move them.
    - **Process (Cube):** Click on the canvas to add a Process step. You can link this step to an existing Process definition.
    - **Decision (Diamond):** Click on the canvas to add a Decision point (gateway).
    - **Group (Box):** Click and drag to create a visual grouping container.
    - **Connector (Line):** Click a source node, then click a target node to draw a connecting line (edge).

### Node Configuration
- **Process Steps:** When a process step is selected, you can choose which underlying **Process** it represents using the dropdown in the toolbar. This links the visual step to the detailed process definition.

## Comments
The Comments panel allows you to collaborate or leave reminders. Comments are saved with the journey and can be edited or deleted.
