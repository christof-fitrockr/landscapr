# Capability

Business Capabilities represent *what* a business does to generate value, rather than *how* it does it. They provide a stable view of the business.

## Capability Map
The Capability Map is a hierarchical visualization.
- **Root Capabilities:** Top-level functions (e.g., "Sales", "HR").
- **Child Capabilities:** More granular capabilities nested under roots.

## Editing Capabilities
- **Definition:** Name and describe the capability.
- **Implemented By:** Link to **Systems** that support this capability.
- **Usage:** Link to **API Calls** that provide the technical functions for this capability.

## Strategic Value
Use the Capability map to identify:
- **Redundancy:** Multiple systems implementing the same capability.
- **Gaps:** Critical capabilities with no system support.
