# Api Call (Functions)

The Api Call section acts as a technical catalog of the functions or services available in your landscape. These are often referred to as "Functions" in the context of a process flow.

## Catalog
- **List View:** Browse all API definitions.
- **Groups:** Organize APIs into logical groups (e.g., by domain or service family).

## Api Call Editor
- **Base:** Define the Name, Description, and link to the **System** that provides this API.
- **Usage:** See which Processes and Capabilities utilize this API. This helps in impact analysis—knowing what might break if this API changes.
- **Implemented In:** (If applicable) See where the implementation logic resides.

## Linking
API Calls bridge the gap between business processes and technical systems.
- **Link to Process:** Add an API Call as a step in a Process to show *how* a business step is technically executed.
- **Link to Capability:** Associate an API with a Business Capability to show IT support for business goals.
