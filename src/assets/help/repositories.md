# Repositories

Landscapr supports saving your data locally in the browser and synchronizing it with a remote Git repository (GitHub).

## Configuration
- **GitHub Token:** You need a personal access token from GitHub to enable synchronization.
- **Repository Name:** The name of the repository to sync with.
- **Branch:** The branch to use (e.g., `main` or `master`).

## Data Management
- **Local Storage:** By default, changes are saved to your browser's Local Storage. This means data persists across reloads but is specific to your browser/device.
- **Sync:** Use the Dashboard sync controls to Push (save to Git) or Pull (load from Git). This allows you to share data or move between devices.
